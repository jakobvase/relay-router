/**
 * IMPORTANT!
 *
 * This is a shim for React v18's useTransition hook.
 * If the consumer is using a version of React with the useTransition hook,
 * we will use the built in hook, otherwise we will use the shim.
 *
 * The behavior of yarr is different depending on whether the consumer is using.
 *
 * When using the official hook from React, yarr will continue rendering the previous route
 * if the new route has suspended (because of preload data). When using the shim, yarr will
 * not be able to keep the previous route rendered when the new route suspenses awaiting data,
 * instead you will render the parent suspense boundary, which _can_ lead to awkward UX.
